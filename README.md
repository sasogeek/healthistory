HealtHistory is a health records database for patients, accessible by both patients and hospitals; albeit patient records can only be updated by a doctor.

To run HealtHistory, clone the repo, change directory into `healthistory` and run the command `meteor`.

# NB
You must have [meteor](http://meteor.com) installed already in order to run this app.
